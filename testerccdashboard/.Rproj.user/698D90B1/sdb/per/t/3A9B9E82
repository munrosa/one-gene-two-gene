Two types of data from the SEQC/MAQC III project were analyzed.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item Rat toxicogenomics treatment and control samples for two different drug treatments\n  \\item Human reference RNA samples from the MAQC I project, Universal Human Reference RNA (UHRR) and Human Brain Reference RNA (HBRR)\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\section{Set parameters}\nDefine the input parameters for the experiment. The parameters study name, the sequencing siteName, the platform type, and analysis.\n<<outputNames, keep.source=T>>=\nstudy = \"SEQC_RatTox\"; \nsiteName = \"COH\";\nplatform = \"ILM\";\nanalysis = \"RatTox\";\n@\nNext we need to name the samples.\nIn the Rat toxicogenomics data we are analyzing:\n  Samples with ERCC Mix 2, sample2, are the control (CTL) rats\n  Samples with ERCC Mix 1, sample1, are the treated rats\n\nThe user can choose NIT, THI, MET, 3ME, or NAP drug treatments and the appropriate control data sets (with the same drug delivery method) will be selected.\n\nMeasurements of the NIT and THI samples (and corresponding CTL samples) were with the same instrument, different library prep, and different sequencing dates \nMeasurements of the 3ME, MET, and NAP samples (and corresponding CTL samples) were with the same instrument, same library prep, and same sequencing dates \n<<sampleSelection, keep.source=TRUE>>=\n# Provide names for sample1 and sample2\nsample1 = \"NIT\"\nsample2 = \"CTL\"\n@\n\n\n<<>>=\nDEtest = T; # DEtest, if TRUE run Differential Expression testing on the data, if FALSE,\nchoseFDR = 0.1; # choose an acceptable false discovery rate, FDR = 0.05 is a common choice\ntotalSeqReads = T;  #totalSeqReads - if TRUE, use the number of sequenced reads in FASTQ file for library size normalization, if FALSE use number of mapped reads for library size normalization\n# ERCCdilution, the dilution factor for ERCC mixtures\nERCCdilution = 1/100;\n# spikeVol, the amount of diluted ERCC mix spiked into the total RNA sample, units are in microliters\nspikeVol = 1;\n# totalRNAmass = mass of total RNA spiked with the diluted ERCC mix, units are in micrograms\ntotalRNAmass = 0.500;\n\n# convert the Ambion pool codes (\"Ratio\") to the corresponding fold changes, \"FC\"\nFCcode = data.frame(Ratio = c(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\"),FC =  c(4,1,.667,.5));\n\n# Set legend labels and limits for dashboard plots\nlegendLabels = c(\"4:1\",\"1:1\",\"1:1.5\",\"1:2\");\nmyYLimMA = c(-3.5,3.5);\nmyXLim = c(-10,15);\n\nprintPDF = T; # printPDF - if TRUE, write dashboard plots to a pdf file, if FALSE plots will be generated but not saved to PDF\n\n@\n\n\n\n\\section{Now make a ggplot}\n\\end{document}",
